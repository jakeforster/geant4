#+title: Geant4 Examples 

This is a personal collection of [[http://cern.ch/geant4][Geant4]] example applications developed to demonstrate useful functionality in the Geant4 toolkit.

* Example applications

The examples are briefly described below.
More information can be found in the README in the example's directory.

** A1

This example adds some useful features to the basic example ~B1~ distributed with Geant4:
- Set and record the seeds.
- Use GPS instead of particle gun.
- Score information in ntuples and histograms.
- Use physics list files.

** A2

Example A2 adds a radioactive source to example A1. 
It also demonstrates confinement of a source to a volume.

* Testing

The examples are tested on Geant4 releases from 11.1.1 to 11.2.0 inclusive (see ~run-tests.sh~).

* License
